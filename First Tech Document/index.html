        Nobody's got to sell you on why you ought to want Nissan's Skyline GT-R. 
        What began as a performance-based spinoff of a luxury car made by a 
        manufacturer you've never even heard of later culminated into the twin-turbo, 
        all-wheel drive R32 GT-R produced from '89 to '94 that boy racer fantasies 
        are made of and that much of today's import-tuning landscape owes a debt to. 
        It's a car that dominated the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC), 
        claimed numerous victories in Australia, and that, some three decades later, 
        you've got a shot at owning.

        But you ordering up an R32 GT-R of your own isn't as straightforward as the 
        time you bought that Tercel off of your aunt. And, as it turns out, owning 
        one can be even trickier. To help make things more like that experience with 
        your aunt and that Tercel, we hooked up with GT-R expert Sean Morris of Long 
        Beach, California's Toprank International Vehicle Importers, who's responsible 
        for delivering more than 150 R32 GT-Rs stateside and whose experience with the 
        icon of a chassis dates back to your days on the merry-go-round.

        You getting an R32 GT-R will never be as easy as you plopping down a week's 
        pay for some raggedly old Civic hatchback. Here, just about everyone's against 
        you, including the federal government, the EPA, and whatever DMV you think you'll 
        be registering it at. Try going the purchase process alone and you'll either spend 
        way too much or end up with something that'll only get taken away from you at some 
        point. Look to a firm like Toprank International Vehicle Importers, though, who's 
        legally imported and sold more than 150 R32 GT-Rs, and you're on your way to doing 
        things right.

      <p>
        Today, you taking advantage of the R32 GT-R's age is your best bet at legally 
        importing one. Since it's more than 25 years old—the federal government's 
        cutoff—all of a sudden things like crash tests, emissions, and DOT requirements 
        aren't as important as they once were. There are caveats, though. First, that GT-R 
        had better have its original engine or an EPA-approved equivalent. And second, 
        depending on the state you'll be registering it in, that GT-R still might not be 
        emissions-compliant even though the feds say it is.

      <p>
        If you are really debating on getting an R32 GT-R, you should be prepared for some
        common issues and problems that you should seriously condider fixing before those issues
        spiral out of control throwing you into an even bigger problem. As they say "more money, 
        more problems" but just reverse that saying: "more problems, more money". 
      </p
     >
      <p>
        One of the most common issues found on R32s is rust. It's not Nissan's fault. 
        Let's give Japan's weather some credit for this. When we're shopping for R32s 
        this is one of the major issues that we look out for. Common areas of rust? 
        Pinch rails, trunk channels, rear windshield wiper, the entire underside of 
        the car. If you're in the market for an R32; be on the look out. FLEX FLEX FLEX. 
        The chassis flexes more than your meathead friend at the gym.

        The R32 GT-R is a car that you need to be on top of. Keeping it in its best
        best condition at all time considering that it is a rather old car being over
        25 years old. Below you will see some common fault codes that are associated
        with the Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R.

        You already know that the R32 GT-R's powered by the almighty RB26DETT engine 
        and that it's got an AWD layout. That is, in part, why you need one. For Nissan, 
        FIA homologation was always a consideration when developing this engine, which 
        means it was built with a purpose—to go racing. Nissan will tell you that the 2.6L, 
        twin-cam, inline-six is good for a maximum of 276 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque, but 
        history's revealed that those figures are nothing short of conservative. The RB26DETT 
        is based off of things like a nearly indestructible cast-iron block, parallel-mounted 
        twin turbos, and individual throttle bodies. Together, they make up a recipe that 
        stinks of '90s supercars and that today's automotive manufacturers with their dinky 
        hybrids and belt-driven transmissions have all but forgotten about.
      </p

        It's the AWD layout that makes the GT-R a GT-R, though. The longitudinally mounted 
        engine up front bolts up to what you think looks like a regular, old RWD transmission 
        that allows it to behave more like something powered by its hind end until you let 
        things get squirrelly. Nissan does all of this with ATTESA E-TS (Advanced Total 
        Traction Engineering System for All-Terrain, Electronic Torque Split), a system based 
        off of that RWD-style gearbox that drives the rear differential through a standard 
        tailshaft. At the end of the transmission sits the AWD transfer case where a short 
        driveshaft travels back to the front wheels through another differential. Inside 
        the transfer case a multi-plate clutch pack distributes torque. Information like 
        G-force, throttle position, and individual wheel speed is fed into the computer. 
        If traction's lost, the clutches intervene, engaging and splitting torque up evenly. 
        It's sophisticated, it's elegant, and you want it.

        This section is only for someone who lives in the US who is considering getting an 
        R32 GT-R. Every car that is made and bought in the US are all left-hand drive, 
        meaning the steering wheel is on the left side of the car. An R32 on the other hand, 
        which were only made in Japan, are all right-hand drive meaning the steering wheel 
        is on the right side of the car. This may feel rather awkward for a driver who has 
        always driven left-hand drive. But with just a little driving, you can really get 
        accustomed to it.
