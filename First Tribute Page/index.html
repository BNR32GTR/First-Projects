     <h2 class="par-titles" id="read-about-him">About Superman</h2>
     <p id="tribute-info" class="par">Supermans first appearance was in April 18, 1938. Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named Kal-El. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and editor-in-chief Perry White, and enemies such as Brainiac, Darkseid, General Zod, and his archenemy Lex Luthor.</p>

     <h2 class="par-titles" id="learn-more">Superman's Impact on the World</h2>
     <p id="tribute-info2" class="par">Superman shows us the best of humanity and what we have the potential to become despite not being an actual human. He represents the good in all of us and he shows us that good can always triumph over evil. This is the reason he has lasted so long, and this is why he will last even longer. I hope people will still be able to talk about the Man of Tomorrow in 2050. I think we are facing times that are getting dangerously reminiscent of when Superman was first created. There are some bad things happening, and people are scared again. We could really use a hero right now, but Superman shows us that heroes are never far away. Some can be at our side faster than a speeding bullet.</p>
