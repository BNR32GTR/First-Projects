          The Skyline’s extensive racing pedigree played out both in real life
          and as a poster child for almost every PlayStation Gran Turismo video
          game. The Skyline became a go-to choice for many gamers playing the
          likes of Need for Speed, where a digital version would be the closest
          they’d ever get to driving any Skyline iteration. Alongside its video
          game appearances, the Skyline was a lead car in numerous Fast and
          Furious films, such as the one driven by Paul Walker playing Brian
          O’Connor whose blue and silver 1999 GT-R R34 became an icon in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Skylines are a holy grail of the car world, a unicorn to most
          and a challenge for many others as they navigate import regulations
          and sky-rocketing prices.

        <p>
          In 1969 Nissan developed its first performance-focused Skyline — what
          is commonly referred to as the “Hakosuka.” The Hakosuka put Nissan’s
          racing legacy into gear. While the production model produced a healthy
          160 HP — strong figures for a two-liter car from the late ‘60s — its
          racing variant, complete with a long list of upgrades, won 52 races in
          its first three years of production. Today, the Hakosuka is a
          six-figure collectible. Nissan had to produce a successor to Hakosuka,
          and introduced the C110 Skyline in 1973. It was an instant hit, with
          the GT-R model earning the nickname “Kenmeri” thanks to its popular
          advertising campaign featuring a young couple named Ken and Mary.
          However, the oil crisis in the 1970s meant that production was
          short-lived, and the demand for performance cars died out. The closest
          to a GT-R following “Kenmeri” was the R31 Skyline, appearing in GTS-R
          format in a limited run of just 823 units in the mid to late ‘80s.
        </p>
        <p>
          This level of engineering meant that the Nissan Skyline GT-R R32 was
          able to take on supercars from completely different markets. It raced
          the Porsche 959, a limited-edition offering from the ‘80s that
          pioneered the all-wheel-drive systems and turbochargers used in
          supercars today. What’s particularly interesting is that an R32 cost
          around $31,000 USD when new, whereas a 959 would cost you $225,000
          USD. Nissan beat Porsche time and time again in Group A class races (a
          series of production-derived vehicles intended for outright
          competition in touring car racing and rallying). However, Nissan was
          so successful in Group A races that racing moderators were indirectly
          forced to change the rules and requirements, following the marque’s
          winning streak between 1989 and 1993 in the Japanese Touring Car
          Championship. In 1991, Australia became the GT-R’s first export market
          and went on to dominate the Australian Bathurst racing series, leaving
          Australian V8 race cars and the Ford Sierra Cosworth (an outright
          winner in European Group A races and a cult ‘80s car) in its dust — in
          turn becoming what Australian press referred to as “Godzilla,”
          likening it to a Japanese monster.

          A coupe packed with the latest technology on the market and an
          advanced engine: the RB26DETT. It featured a twin-turbo, individual
          throttle body for all the six pistons, water-cooled ceramic
          turbochargers with ball-bearings and the list can go on. The Skyline
          R34 had an intelligent all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear
          differential (LSD), which helped the car accelerate faster on the
          corner's exits. An important feature of the car was the
          Multi-Function-Display (MFD) that was mounted on the dashboard. This
          display showed many of the car's engine stats including boost
          pressure, oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car, this kind of
          technology was very rare and advanced at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stated power output of the engine was 280 hp, as part of a
          gentleman agreement between the Japanese car-manufacturers to not
          advertise more power than that. But in reality, the car was dyno-ed at
          330 hp. Due to its cast-iron engine block and forged internals, it
          supported many modifications and some were modified to offer over 1000
          hp.

          The GT-R R35 is a true homage to its “Godzilla” heritage. Like all
          that preceded it, the R35 features four round rear lights, a notable
          rear wing, aggressive styling, a sloped coupe body, a turbocharged
          six-cylinder engine, all-wheel-drive and supercar-killing performance
          figures. However, today’s GT-R is somewhat of a supercar itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nissan dropped the Skyline moniker for the 2008 R35, giving the name
          to its luxury models in Japan, harking back to what a Skyline was in
          the 1950s. Today’s GT-R has come in many iterations, from NISMO tunes
          to a 50th anniversary edition, and even served as the inspiration for
          the GTR-50. Little is known about the new model, but it’s safe to
          assume that Nissan will continue to be innovative with its
          engineering, meaning we could see hybrid power derived from its GT-R
          LM Nismo race car and design cues taken from the GTR-50. Nissan is
          rumored to be stocking the R36 in showrooms before 2025, which is set
          to be the most expensive and powerful performance-driven model to
          date.
